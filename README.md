🚀 Learning by Doing: My First Interactive Sales Dashboard in Python! 📊

As I continue growing in my data science and analytics journey, I challenge myself to go beyond spreadsheets and create a visual dashboard using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

🔍 What I Did:
Using a retail dataset, I:
✅ Cleaned and transformed the data
✅ Calculated new metrics like Price Per Box
✅ Aggregated KPIs: Total Revenue, Boxes Sold, and Customers
✅ Built a 2x3 dashboard with:

📈 A Cumulative Revenue Pareto Analysis

📊 A Box Quantity Distribution Histogram

🔥 A Correlation Heatmap

🧾 Custom metric cards using Matplotlib patches

💡 Business Insights & Value:
Revenue Trends: The cumulative revenue chart shows that a small number of sales contribute most of the revenue — ideal for Pareto (80/20) analysis.

Customer & Product Focus: Metric cards offer at-a-glance visibility into high-level performance.

Inventory Planning: The distribution of boxes gives insights into how often certain quantities are sold.

Strategic Pricing: The correlation matrix reveals relationships between pricing, box volume, and customers.

🔧 These kinds of dashboards can empower sales, operations, and finance teams to make faster, data-informed decisions.

This project helped me see how data becomes powerful when visualised and contextualised for business impact.

Next up: deploying this dashboard and automating updates! 💻✨
